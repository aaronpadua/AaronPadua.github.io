# AaronPadua.github.io

1. Aaron Padua 
2. acpadua@my.waketech.edu
3. The repository I created has my name along with GitHub.io
4. To clone my repository into my local  machine, I cloned it via GitHub desktop "Clone Repository" command. 
   Next thing I did was title my summary in the bottom left and filled the description, pressed "Commit to main", then finally pressed "Push" to send it back to GitHub.
